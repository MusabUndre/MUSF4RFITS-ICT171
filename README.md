## Overview:
This project is a website developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, implementing a Linux-based web server (Apache 2).  
Making use of an IaaS platform, it would be hosted over Amazon Web Services EC2.  
This website would allow users to simply:
- Select muscle groups they would want to train
- Plan and organize these workouts across different days of the week
The project itself demonstrates actual server deployment, front-end design, and documentation skills.
